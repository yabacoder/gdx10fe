How to set axios.defaults.withCredentials = true; in Redux RTK

CSRF Protection
To authenticate your SPA, your SPA's "login" page should first make a request to the /sanctum/csrf-cookie endpoint to initialize CSRF protection for the application:

axios.get('/sanctum/csrf-cookie').then(response => {
    // Login...
});

If your JavaScript HTTP library does not set the value for you, you will need to manually set the X-XSRF-TOKEN header to match the value of the XSRF-TOKEN cookie that is set by this route.
