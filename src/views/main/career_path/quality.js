//                                                     An average of 100 software related products are pushed daily across the globe and it involves lots of processes towards its development and the eventual end product. To accurately develop a product that meets customers’ specific needs as well as align with company’s goals and guidelines of regulatory bodies, different roles have to be played by a diverse group of professionals. One of them is a Quality Assurance Engineer, who ensures that the development of the software is seamless by breaking the entire procedure to smaller chunks and monitoring every phase associated with it. Doing this prevents people involve to become overwhelmed.

//                                                     Being fluent in programming languages, such as Java, C++ and C# is your first foot at the door as a Quality Assurance Engineer. There’s often a misconception about the role of a software tester and a quality assurance engineer, the former test software at different stages of the development while the latter oversees the entire lifecycle of the development. Quality Assurance Engineers at the beginning of their career focus more on software testing; execution and bugs reporting. They also develop a succinct way of communicating which prepare them for more quality assurance tasks. The entry-level is a good way to gain valuable experience that will guide the individual to a more technical role.

These people usually have at least 1-2 years of experience. While on the job to gain more, they become accustomed to software testing and establish strong communication skills to further prepare them for more demanding activities.

A well-founded QA engineer will most times divide the process into smaller part for efficient control to achieve the set goal. They usually work 40 hours or more depending on the complexities of the project in order to attend meetings and meet deadlines. Because QA engineers spend a lot of time in front of their computers which poses a health threat, some companies have creatively encouraged them to take time off the screen by introducing sleep pods, indoor game activities, in-house masseuse and other recreational exercises.
